This package describes a simple prototype to process
[BoxCar](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0003-5) data using
the [`MSnbase`](http://lgatto.github.io/MSnbase/) package. Is is meant
as an illustration of how to use `MSnbase` to prototype and develop
computational mass spectrometry methods and not to replace the
reference `MaxQuant` implementation.
